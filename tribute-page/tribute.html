                <h3>Quotes of Quaid</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>No nation can rise to the height of glory unless your women are side by side with you.</li>
                    <li>With
                        faith, discipline and selfless devotion to duty, there is nothing worthwhile that you cannot
                        achieve. </li>
                    <li>Think 100 times before you take a decision, But once that decision is
                        taken, stand by it as one man.
                    </li>There are two powers in the world; one is the sword and the other is the pen. There is a great
                    competition and rivalry between the two. There is a third power stronger than both, that of the
                    women.
                    <li>Democracy is in the blood of the Muslims, who
                        look upon complete equality of mankind, and believe in fraternity, equality, and liberty.
                    </li>
                    <li>You will have to make up for the smallness of your size by your courage and selfless devotion to
                        duty, for it is not life that matters, but the courage, fortitude and determination you bring to
                        it.</li>
                    <li>The great majority of us are Muslims. We follow the teachings of the Prophet Mohammed (may
                        peace be upon him). We are members of the brotherhood of Islam in which all are equal in rights,
                        dignity and self-respect. Consequently, we have a special and a very deep sense of unity. But
                        make no mistake: Pakistan is not a theocracy or anything like it.
                    </li>
                    <li>Islam expect every Muslim to
                        do this duty, and if we realise our responsibility time will come soon when we shall justify
                        ourselves worthy of a glorious past </li>
                    <li>I sincerely hope that they (relations between India and
                        Pakistan) will be friendly and cordial. We have a great deal to do...and think that we can be of
                        use to each other and to the world.
                    </li>
                    <li>Failure is a word unknown to me.</li>
                    <li>My message to you all is of hope, courage, and confidence. </li>
                </ul>
